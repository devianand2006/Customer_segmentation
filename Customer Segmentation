This Python code utilizes K-means clustering to segment customers based on their age, annual income, and spending score attributes. After loading and preprocessing the dataset, including standardizing the features, the code determines the optimal number of clusters using the Elbow method. It then performs K-means clustering with the identified optimal number of clusters and assigns cluster labels to each data point. Finally, the code visualizes the clusters in a 2D scatter plot, enabling easy interpretation of customer segmentation patterns for targeted marketing or service strategies.
